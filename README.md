# About Satsails

Satsails is a self-custodial Bitcoin and Liquid Network platform that offers non-custodial atomic swaps across Bitcoin, Lightning, and Liquid. The philosophy of Satsails is to become a platform for everything and anything Bitcoin. Many more features are coming soon!

We are committed to being open source and transparent, offering a non-custodial service.

**Everything we build is designed to be held and operated by you. We either use on-device technology or connect you to partner companies.**

## Data Collection

As part of our operations, we collect a **unique identifier** and register it on our server. This identifier is in no way related to your wallet. Additionally, we register a **public key**, which is used solely to direct your fiat payments and ensure that these payments are routed directly to your wallet.

This is the only data we ever collect on our systems

### PIX Metadata

When using PIX for payments, the metadata includes the **CPF** and the **name** of the person. This is collected by our partners
